👋 Hi! I'm **Wenyu Zeng**, a PhD student in the **Biomedical and Health Informatics** program at the **University of Washington**.  
My research combines **spatial transcriptomics**, **single-cell RNA-sequencing**, and **machine learning** to better understand **glioblastoma**, one of the most aggressive brain cancers.

---

### 🧬 Research Focus
My work centers on building computational pipelines for **NanoString CosMx** spatial molecular data, including:
- Quality control and normalization of high-plex spatial data  
- Integration with scRNA-seq datasets to identify cell-type-specific spatial patterns  
- Copy-number-variation and pathway analyses to discover potential therapeutic targets  

Ultimately, I aim to develop scalable, reproducible workflows that bridge molecular spatial data with clinical insights in neuro-oncology.

### 🧑‍💻 Background
Before joining UW, I earned an **M.S. in Data Science** from **George Washington University** and a **B.S. in Statistics** from the **University of Pittsburgh**.  
I also worked as a **postbaccalaureate fellow at the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS)**, where I built predictive models for chemical permeability and toxicity using machine-learning methods.

### 🎓 Fellowships & Projects
- **TL1 Translational Research Training Program Fellow (2024–2026)** – Institute of Translational Health Sciences (ITHS)  
- **CosMx Glioblastoma Pipeline Project** – developing multimodal spatial analysis frameworks  
- **Seattle Alzheimer’s Disease Atlas (SEA-AD)** – integrating spatial omics data across neurodegenerative cohorts

### 🌐 Outside the Lab
I enjoy mentoring students in math and science, crocheting, and exploring Seattle’s coffee and art scene.  
Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wz96) or check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/wzeng96).
