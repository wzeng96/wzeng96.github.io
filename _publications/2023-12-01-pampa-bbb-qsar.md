We developed and validated QSAR models for **PAMPA-BBB** permeability using the largest curated dataset to date, achieving accurate prediction of brain penetration potential for novel small molecules. The approach provides an **orthogonal** in silico estimate alongside in vivo and cell-based assays, supporting earlier go/no-go decisions in CNS drug discovery.
