We designed an **LLM-powered chatbot prototype** tailored for retirement community residents to bridge gaps in technology and eHealth literacy.  
Using a **human-centered design process**, we conducted interviews, built personas, and refined usability through pilot testing.  
The final chatbot—built with **GPT-3.5 Turbo** and **Streamlit**—supports adjustable text size, theme control, and personalized follow-ups.  
Results from a pilot trial showed high satisfaction and ease of use, emphasizing the potential of accessible, AI-driven interfaces to empower older adults.
